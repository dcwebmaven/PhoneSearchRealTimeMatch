# PhoneSearchRealTimeMatch
This AJAX project enables real-time search matching.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and an XML document. Make it so that the HTML document will search for an entry as the name is being typed into the text field. 
That is, matches should be returned in real-time. In addition, the search should be case-INsensitive. This means that if j is typed into the text field, both John and Jane should be displayed.
